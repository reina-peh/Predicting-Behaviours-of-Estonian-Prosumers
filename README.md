# Predicting-Behaviours-of-Estonian-Prosumers

This is a machine learning project about predicting energy consumption behaviours of Estonian prosumers using Python. Below is an outline of the steps I have taken in building a predictive model:  

Steps:  
1. EDA  
2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
3. Model Training  
4. Validation Metric (MAE)  
5. Ensemble

Models:
1. XGBoost  
2. CatBoost  
3. LGBM  
4. Neural Networks

Codes are not released
